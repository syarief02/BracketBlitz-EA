BracketBlitz is a MetaTrader Expert Advisor (available for both **MT4** and **MT5**) that continuously places bracket pending orders around the live price. When one side triggers, the other is instantly cancelled (**One-Cancels-Other**). If neither triggers within the configurable time window, both are deleted and re-placed at the current price — keeping your entries razor-close to the action.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔀 **OCO Bracket Orders** | Simultaneously places a Buy Stop above and a Sell Stop below the current price. When one triggers, the other is instantly deleted. |
| ⏱️ **Auto-Refresh Timer** | Pending orders auto-cancel & re-place every 30 seconds (configurable) so your entries never go stale. |
| 🎯 **Smart Trailing Stop** | Automatically trails the stop loss as price moves in your favour. Only moves SL in the profitable direction — never against you. |
| ⚙️ **Fully Configurable** | Gap distance, stop loss, trailing distance, lot size, refresh timer, and magic number — all adjustable from the EA inputs dialog at runtime. |
| 🧹 **Clean Lifecycle Management** | All pending orders belonging to this EA are automatically deleted when the EA is removed from the chart, ensuring no orphaned orders. |
| 🔢 **Magic Number Isolation** | Each instance uses a unique magic number so it never interferes with your other EAs, manual trades, or other BracketBlitz instances. |
| 📊 **Universal Broker Support** | Automatically detects and adjusts pip calculations for all broker configurations — 4-digit, 5-digit, 3-digit (JPY pairs), and 2-digit. |
| 🔄 **Dual Platform** | Full native implementations for both MetaTrader 4 (MQL4) and MetaTrader 5 (MQL5). Not a compatibility wrapper — each is written for its platform's native API. |

### Tick-by-Tick Lifecycle

Every tick, the EA runs through **4 sequential steps**:

1. **OCO Check** — Did one of our pending orders get filled? If yes → immediately delete the opposite pending order.
2. **Trailing Stop** — For any open position owned by this EA, adjust the stop loss to trail behind the current price.
3. **Expiry Check** — Have the pending orders been alive longer than `OrderLifetimeSec`? If yes → delete both and flag for re-placement.
4. **Re-placement** — If no pending orders exist and no tickets are tracked, place a fresh pair of Buy Stop + Sell Stop at the current price.

## 📖 Strategy Explained

BracketBlitz implements a **breakout-capture** strategy designed for volatile market conditions:

### 1. Bracket Placement
Two pending orders straddle the current price:
- **Buy Stop** at `Ask + GapPips` — catches upward breakouts
- **Sell Stop** at `Bid − GapPips` — catches downward breakouts

### 2. OCO Execution
The moment price breaks through one level and triggers an order, the opposite side is **immediately deleted**. This prevents the EA from opening conflicting positions and keeps your exposure directional.

### 3. Fresh Entries
If neither order triggers within 30 seconds (configurable), both are deleted and re-placed at the **new current price**. This keeps the bracket tight around the latest price action rather than leaving stale orders behind during range-bound markets.

### 4. Trailing Protection
Once in a trade, the stop loss automatically follows price movement:
- **Buy positions**: SL moves up as `Bid` rises, but never moves back down
- **Sell positions**: SL moves down as `Ask` falls, but never moves back up

This locks in profits as the breakout extends while giving the trade room to breathe.

### When Does It Work Best?

| Market Condition | Performance |
|---|---|
| **High-volatility breakouts** (news events, session opens) | ✅ Excellent — captures sharp moves |
| **Trending markets** | ✅ Good — rides momentum with trailing stop |
| **Range-bound / choppy markets** | ⚠️ Caution — frequent SL hits possible |
| **Low-liquidity periods** | ⚠️ Caution — wider spreads may cause slippage |

## ⚙️ Configuration

All parameters are adjustable from the EA input dialog when attaching to a chart:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LotSize` | `double` | `0.01` | 0.01 – broker max | Trade volume per order. Keep small for testing. |
| `GapPips` | `int` | `50` | 1 – 500 | Distance (in pips) from current price where pending orders are placed. Smaller = more fills, larger = stronger breakouts only. |
| `StopLossPips` | `int` | `50` | 1 – 500 | Stop loss distance (in pips) from the entry price. Sets initial risk per trade. |
| `TrailingStopPips` | `int` | `20` | 1 – 500 | Trailing stop distance (in pips). Once in profit, SL trails this far behind current price. Smaller = tighter trail, locks profit faster but may exit early. |
| `OrderLifetimeSec` | `int` | `30` | 5 – 3600 | Seconds before unfilled pending orders are cancelled & refreshed. Shorter = tighter brackets, more order churn. |
| `MagicNumber` | `int`/`long` | `123456` | Any unique value | Unique identifier for this EA's orders. **Change this if running multiple instances** on different charts. |

### Tuning Tips

- **Scalping (M1/M5)**: Try `GapPips=10`, `StopLossPips=15`, `TrailingStopPips=8`, `OrderLifetimeSec=15`
- **Swing (H1/H4)**: Try `GapPips=100`, `StopLossPips=80`, `TrailingStopPips=40`, `OrderLifetimeSec=120`
- **News Trading**: Try `GapPips=30`, `StopLossPips=50`, `TrailingStopPips=20`, `OrderLifetimeSec=10`

## 🏗️ Code Architecture

### MT4 Version (`BracketBlitz.mq4`)

Uses MQL4's classic order management system where pending orders and open positions share a **unified order pool**. Key characteristics:

- `OrderSend()` / `OrderModify()` / `OrderDelete()` for all trade operations
- `OrderSelect()` with `SELECT_BY_POS` or `SELECT_BY_TICKET` to access order data
- Ticket tracked as `int` (signed integer, `-1` = no order)
- When a pending order fills, it stays in the same pool with a changed `OrderType()` (e.g., `OP_BUYSTOP` → `OP_BUY`)

### MT5 Version (`BracketBlitz.mq5`)

Uses MQL5's modern trade architecture with **separate pools** for orders and positions:

- `CTrade` class (from `<Trade\Trade.mqh>`) for sending/modifying/deleting orders
- `OrdersTotal()` / `OrderGetTicket()` — accesses the **pending order** pool
- `PositionsTotal()` / `PositionGetTicket()` — accesses the **open position** pool
- Ticket tracked as `ulong` (unsigned long, `0` = no order)
- When a pending order fills, it moves from the **order pool** to the **position pool** — detection requires checking both pools

### Shared Logic Flow

Both versions implement identical trading logic:

```
OnInit()
  └─ PlacePendingOrders()

OnTick()
  ├─ Step 1: OCO check (IsFilledOrder → DeletePendingOrder)
  ├─ Step 2: Trailing stop (ApplyTrailingStop)
  ├─ Step 3: Expiry check (TimeCurrent - placedTime ≥ lifetime)
  └─ Step 4: Re-place if no pending orders exist

OnDeinit()
  └─ DeleteAllPendingOrders()
```

## 📚 Function Reference

### Core Functions

| Function | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PipSize()` | `double` | Returns the pip value adjusted for the broker's digit configuration. Returns `Point*10` for 3/5-digit brokers, `Point` otherwise. |
| `PlacePendingOrders()` | `void` | Calculates Buy Stop and Sell Stop prices from the current market price, places both orders, and stores their tickets + placement time. |
| `ApplyTrailingStop()` | `void` | Iterates all open positions owned by this EA and moves the SL to trail behind the current price. Never moves SL against the trade. |

### Order Management

| Function | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CountPendingOrders()` | `int` | Counts how many pending orders (Buy Stop / Sell Stop) belong to this EA on this symbol. |
| `CountOpenPositions()` | `int` | Counts how many open market positions (Buy / Sell) belong to this EA on this symbol. |
| `IsPendingOrder(ticket)` | `bool` | Checks if a given ticket number is still a live pending order. |
| `IsFilledOrder(ticket)` | `bool` | Checks if a pending order ticket has been triggered and is now an open position. |
| `DeletePendingOrder(ticket)` | `bool` | Deletes a specific pending order by its ticket number. Returns `true` on success. |
| `DeleteAllPendingOrders()` | `void` | Deletes ALL pending orders belonging to this EA on this symbol. Resets stored tickets. |

### Event Handlers

| Function | Called When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OnInit()` | EA attached to chart | Initializes the EA, prints config, places first pair of pending orders. |
| `OnTick()` | Every new tick | Main loop: OCO check → trailing stop → expiry check → re-placement. |
| `OnDeinit()` | EA removed from chart | Cleanup: deletes all pending orders to prevent orphans. |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Sad face on chart** | Algo Trading is disabled | Enable the AutoTrading / Algo Trading button in the MT toolbar |
| **"OrderSend Error 130"** | Invalid stops — too close to price | Increase `GapPips` or `StopLossPips`. Some brokers have a minimum stop distance. |
| **"OrderSend Error 131"** | Invalid lot size | Check your broker's minimum lot size. Adjust `LotSize` accordingly. |
| **"OrderSend Error 134"** | Not enough free margin | Reduce `LotSize` or deposit more funds. |
| **"OrderSend Error 148"** | Too many pending orders | Some brokers limit pending orders. Close some existing orders. |
| **Orders not refreshing** | Timer relies on server time | Ensure your broker's server is responsive. `TimeCurrent()` only updates on new ticks. |
| **Both orders triggered** | Extreme volatility / gap | This is rare but possible during gaps. The OCO check runs tick-by-tick, so both can fill between ticks. |
| **No trades on backtest** | Spread too wide for gap | In Strategy Tester, set a realistic spread. If spread > `GapPips`, orders may fail. |

### Logging

All EA activities are logged to the **Experts** tab. Key log messages:

```
BracketBlitz EA initialized.
Buy Stop placed at 1.08550 SL: 1.08050 Ticket #12345
Sell Stop placed at 1.07550 SL: 1.08050 Ticket #12346
Buy Stop #12345 filled. Deleting Sell Stop #12346
Pending orders expired after 30 seconds. Refreshing...
BracketBlitz EA removed. All pending orders deleted.
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I run BracketBlitz on multiple charts?**
> Yes! Just give each instance a **different `MagicNumber`** so they don't interfere with each other.

**Q: Does it work on all currency pairs?**
> Yes. It works on any instrument available in MetaTrader — forex pairs, gold (XAUUSD), indices, crypto CFDs, etc. The pip calculation auto-adjusts for each symbol's digit configuration.

**Q: Can I use it alongside manual trading?**
> Absolutely. The EA only manages orders with its own `MagicNumber`. It will never touch your manual trades or orders from other EAs.

**Q: Why 30 seconds for the refresh timer?**
> 30 seconds is a balance between keeping entries fresh and avoiding excessive order churn. You can adjust this from 5 seconds (aggressive) to 3600 seconds (passive) via the `OrderLifetimeSec` input.

**Q: Does it set a Take Profit?**
> No. The strategy relies on the **trailing stop** to lock in profit and exit. This allows the trade to ride extended breakouts without a hard exit cap. If you want a TP, you can manually set one on the position after it opens.

**Q: What happens during high-impact news?**
> BracketBlitz is designed for breakout-capture, making it well-suited for news events. However, be aware of:
> - **Wider spreads** during news (may affect order placement)
> - **Slippage** on the fill price
> - **Both orders filling** in a gap scenario (rare but possible)

**Q: MT4 or MT5 — which should I use?**
> Both versions have identical logic. Choose based on your broker:
> - **MT4** — most retail forex brokers, simpler interface
> - **MT5** — newer brokers, more asset classes, faster backtesting
